Hi Matt,

Happy New Year. So how is everything going on in RM ?

When I left RM last year we had a quick discussion about the possibility of my engagement with Rittman Mead as part-time employee together with my main responsibility in Bank of England. However, I did not get much time in the meantime to explore that possibility from my side and continue that discussion with you and Jon. I was quite involved in settling down into my job as you can understand. Now in the beginning of this new year I am thinking if we can discuss that possibility in more serious note if you are interested. I have tried to highlight some of the advantages for both of us in this opportunity and how I can possibly get involved (other than just pure consulting like before).  

1) Just before I left, RM was having a discussion with FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) for a big data related project. I am not sure how far that is progressed, but I got some contacts there in the meantime. As BoE works in collaboration with several other similar regulatory/supervisory institute as well as public sector organisation, I mate quite a few people there in different conferences. FCA's analytics infrastructure is fairly matured, but there are several other similar institute (e.g., Council of Mortgage Lenders, Food Standard Agency, HMRC etc. ) where new scope of Advanced Analytics/Data Science and data warehousing related opportunities are increasing very fast. However, their technical infrastructure is still quite poor. They struggle to find proper technical vendor as it is quite difficult to understand their business properly by techie firms. Those organisations are full of economists and regulators. After working in BoE for almost 1 year, I believe I understand their business fairly well now. At the same time, I am an analytics guy. Hence, I can possibly help you and Morgan to gain more business in those public sector institutes (i.e. in pre-sale/PoC/demo related opportunity). 

2) I have learned a lot about several advanced topics and technologies in data science related domain in the meantime. Hence, I can possibly help RM in training related activities more. I was involved in several exciting project here in the meantime. I am sure that those experiences will help RM in several projects. 

3) So far I can remember, RM formed a Research and Development division before I left (lead by Jordan). I can possibly work with Jordan as well, especially when our time will match more. Our division here is full of PhDs from top universities like Cambridge, Oxford, LSE, LBS, UCL, Imperial etc. in various disciplines (Statistics, Mathematics, Physics, Economics, Finance, Computer Science etc.) We have research collaboration with several top researchers in those universities. Hence, I can possibly leverage mainly the applied side of their brain power in R&D activities in RM. I can help Rittman Mead consulting in several technical research publication and increase RM's brand value. 

4) From my side, this opportunity can be very useful for my long term career planning. Frist of all, I will be in regular touch with all the nice people again and learn from you all. Currently, my domain here is mainly restricted to financial sector. If I get engaged with RM, I can gain experience in many other domain. It can be very useful for me if I want to switch back into pure consulting sector in future (my role here is both internal consulting and research). Besides, I will get probably more freedom to learn and experiment with different technologies specially in Big Data domain. We have fairly good technical infrastructure here (including Data Lab where I am one of the main members), but, because of sensitive nature of our work, getting right data in right format in right platform takes ages because of unnecessary security protocol. Hence, this engagement can help me to stay in up to the speed with state-of-the-art tools and techniques without any delay. 

My work schedule in BoE is quite relaxed and I have full flexibility regarding when I can work. I can work from home whenever I want. Hence, I can probably help RM even in day time as well, not just in evening or weekends as we discussed before. If you want me to visit Brighton office occasionally (say once or twice in a  month), that is also possible. I can possibly stay in touch with you all in slack or phone even though I am working in some research in BoE during office hours. So I do not think time management will be a big issue (I need to take permission from my manager here, but I do not think it will be a problem). Besides, as we have discussed before, I do not need to be in any fixed time contract with RM. I can be in HTBN (Hour To Be Notified) contract. That means, if RM does not need my help in any week, I will not get paid anything for that week. As you can understand, rather than money, I consider it as a very good learning and knowledge sharing opportunity for all of us. However, if you want me to be in any fixed hour part-time contract (say, 10 hours per week on average) that is also fine. There is no visa related issue as well if I work in analytics/consulting domain and working hour is less than 20 hours per week.  

Sorry for sending you such a long mail. I just decided to start the ball rolling in the begining of the year and discuss how I can extend my great experience with you all. Please let me know if you and others (specially Mark and Jon) have any interest in this possibility. We can have more detailed discussion about this in future if needed.  

Have a great year ahead. I am looking forward for hearing back from you.
